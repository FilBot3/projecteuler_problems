Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

finalTerm = 4,000,000
count = 1
firstTerm = 1
secondTerm = 1
thirdTerm = 0
grandTotal = 0

while terms < finalTerm
thirdTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm
if (firstTerm % 2 ==) 
firstTerm = secondTerm + thirdTerm

secondTerm = thirdTerm + firstTerm
